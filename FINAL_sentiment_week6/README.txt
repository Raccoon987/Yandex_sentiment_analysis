Task for this week - https://www.kaggle.com/c/product-reviews-sentiment-analysis

Briefly - I have test data set with product review for classification. To make classifier I should 
collect somewhere train data set with similar reviews. 
To achieve this I am going to parse reviews on mobile phones from big Ukraine e-market rozetka.com.ua 

test.csv - file with reviews to predict;
rozetka_comments.txt, rozetka_comments_1.txt - files with urls to parse
full.csv - parsed reviews
partial.csv - small set of parsed reviews
positive_rev_idx.txt - since number of positive reviews are much larger than number of negative reviews -
                       this file contains randomly searched indexes of "+" reviews that gives the best 
                       accuracy result on training
