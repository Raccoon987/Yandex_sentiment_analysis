Not what I was expecting
1/10

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Not what I was expecting, *spoiler alert* franchise killed lightning McQueen, he never recovers 
to race again. Huge disappointment for my son, it was literally the death of lightning McQueen.

Lightning McQueen then goes on to become the youngest trainer in history bringing to an end his 
career as lightning McQueen. McQueen gives his position to a trainer that is older than the newer 
model Jackson Storm, she happens to be a girl. So my son is waiting for hero to pull through and 
then gets shot down by McQueen giving up. The spot McQueen gives up is won by a trick and not by 
speed. My son is not going to cheer for a new when the old is no more. Definitely early death of 
number 95. Very depressing movie. The trailer was definitely misleading.



Second negative review:

I wanted to like this movie based on the earlier ones and took my kids... was I wrong, it was 
awful. The whole movie is based on the red car trying to get his mojo back because he's too old 
or needs work, and in the end he basically quits. And still gets called the "winner." I don't 
like to overly analyze movies or entertainment and will watch and enjoy things with any 
reasonable message about self-empowerment, until that entertainment tries to shove a ridiculous 
message at people --- defeatist. More or less inane level propaganda, and about how NOT to 
succeed at something at that. If you want to see a real comeback movie, and one that makes a 
little sense, just rent any Rocky. 1 through 7 (or whatever they are on....) There are tons of
 other good ones.



Third positive review:

Just saw this film at an early family showing before the actual release, and I have to say, it was
 a great companion to the original! By that, I mean, you see from Lightning McQueen's perspective
 exactly how Hudson felt in the original film.

Seeing how Lightning makes his way in a group of rookies is very reminiscent of himself against 
the King and Chick Hicks in the original. Ligtning seems to be humbled in this new entry. However,
 Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks voice is surely missed. Even my seven year old son asked!


Glad to see the flashbacks, but sometimes overused. A great movie experience for the whole family.
