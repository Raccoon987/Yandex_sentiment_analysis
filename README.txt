THIS IS ONE OF THE FINAL PROJECTS OF MIPT & YANDEX MACHINE LEARNING COURSERA COURSE

sentiment analysis

In this project, you have to solve the sentiment analysis task of the texts in several different ways.
It all starts with simple experiments on reviews of movies, during which you will build a simple model 
and slightly modify it. Then you will participate in the competition for the sentiment analysis of product
reviews and make an interactive demonstration for your algorithm, which can be shown even to those who 
have never seen Python and machine learning. After that, you will practice in parsing web pages and face 
a brutal reality - with a client who wants a sentiment analysis of reviews for a certain category of 
product, but you will have to collect the training dataset by yourself. Also you have to guess what the 
customer calls "negative" and "positive" review. 

At the end of the project, you will need to make a demonstration for this algorithm, so that the 
client could play with it, and not only focus on the quality that appears from the contest.
